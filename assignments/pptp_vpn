VPN Server:

Step 1: install packages
#yum install epel-release
#yum install pptpd ppp

Step 2: 
Edit the file /etc/pptpd.conf and make the following changes:

localip 192.168.0.1
remoteip 192.168.0.100-200

Replace 192.168.0.1 with the IP address of the VPN server, and 192.168.0.100-200 with a range of IP addresses that will be assigned to VPN clients.

Step 3: 
Edit the file /etc/ppp/pptpd-options and add the following line:
ms-dns 8.8.8.8

Step 4: 
Add the following lines to the file /etc/ppp/chap-secrets to specify the username and password for VPN clients:
<user-name> pptpd <password> *
Replace user-name with the VPN username and password with the VPN password.


Step 5: 
Enable IP forwarding on the VPN server by adding the following line to the file /etc/sysctl.conf:
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Apply the changes with the following command:
#sysctl -p

Step 6: 
Configure iptables firewall rules to allow VPN traffic:

#iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
#iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp+ -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
#iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT
Replace eth0 with the name of your network interface.

Step 7:
Restart the pptpd service:
#systemctl restart pptpd

Great!!!!
Now, VPN clients can connect to the VPN server using PPTP and get an IP address from the range specified in /etc/pptpd.conf.

Client Machine:

Step 1: install package
yum install pptp


Step 2:
Create a configuration file /etc/ppp/peers/vpn-server with the following contents:

pty "pptp server-ip-address --nolaunchpppd"
name user-name
password password
remotename vpn-server
require-mppe-128
require-mschap-v2
persist
noauth

Replace server-ip-address with the IP address of the VPN server, user-name with your VPN username, and password with your VPN password.
Note: these values were set on server at Step 4.

Step 2:
Connect to the VPN using the following command:
#pppd call vpn-server

To verify the connection, check the output of the following command:
ifconfig

You should see a new interface named ppp0 with an IP address assigned by the VPN server.

To disconnect from the VPN, use the following command:
#killall pppd
